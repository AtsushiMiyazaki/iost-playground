      <h2>About IOST Playground</h2>
      <p>
        This is a platform where users can try out smart contract development on
        the IOST blockchain.
      </p>
      <h3>Caveats</h3>
      <p>
        I have decided to mention what you have to be careful about first rather
        than leaving it to the end of this notes.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Assuming not many of you don't read these through, because I don't do
        that if I were you :0) ...)
      </p>
      <h4>About "compile" of the code</h4>
      <p>
        "compile" in IOST context means to create abi files based on contract
        JavaScrip files

      <p>
        You can tell the compiler the parameter type by writing JSDoc-like
        comments, but please be aware that a type should be either 'string',
        'number', or 'bool'. Please refer to{' '}

      <p>Send IOST APIs requests</p>
      <p>
        Write Smart Contracts and publish them onto IOST where it's main net,
